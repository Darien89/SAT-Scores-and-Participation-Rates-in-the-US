    "The U.S. Department of Education wants to promote preparation for global competitiveness and intends to announce a new grant program. <br>The hypothesis is that additional funding to the states will increase the states' SAT participation and SAT scores. This project examines the relationship between per pupil funding, the SAT participation and SAT scores for the years 2018 and 2019, with a recommendation on how to best distribute the additional funding."
